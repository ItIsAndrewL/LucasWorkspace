# Instructions for AJ10 Project 1: Juni Bakery

The starter code consists of two completed inner classes: the BakedGood class & the Worker class, both nested inside the Bakery class. Start by implementing both the hireWorkers() and addBakedGoods() methods. Each method should get the necessary information to create the objects and add the objects to the appropriate ArrayList. Then implement the toString() method. Finally create a bakery, hire workers, add baked goods, and print out the result!
