#### Can you think of some cases in which we would want to use encapsulation and mark our fields as `private`?
Hint: In class I mentioned the case when our phone stores our Social Security Number (SSN),
and how we don't want just any other code (say the Jetpack Joyride game) to have access
to our SSN.

## Nested Classes

I realize I didn't do quite the best job explaining this topic in class, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwkmIXjWWJc)
does a great job explaining it, and goes over what the difference is between a *static nested class* and an *inner class*.

The jist:
* An inner class needs an **instance** of the outer class to be created in order for it to be created
* A static nested class does **NOT** need an instance of the outer class to be created
  * Since its marked `static`!

[This code example](https://replit.com/@JuniLearning/AJ10-Nested-Classes#Main.java) from Juni also does a good job highlighting the difference.

#### In `Bakery.java` what class is the outer class, and which classes are the inner classes?

Outer Class:

Inner Class:

#### T/F The outer class has access to all of it's nested classes' fields?

Answer Here:

#### Assume we have a java class, `Class.java` that represents a class at school. Inside `Class.java` we define a nested class, `Student` which represents students enrolled in a class.
#### Does it make more sense to have `Student` be an *inner class* or a *static nested class*? and why?

Thanks again lucas!! See you next time!
