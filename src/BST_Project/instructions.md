A Binary Search Tree (BST) is an ordered tree in which every node has a maximum of two children. The fact that it’s ordered means that given a parent, everything in the left subtree is less than the parent and everything in the right subtree is greater than the parent. Create a basic binary search tree using the interface that’s been given. Your implementation will store integers and won’t allow duplicates. Write a node inner class that can store data and point to a left and right child. Implement all the methods in the interface except for the clear() and remove() methods. Test the public methods you wrote in the main file!
