public class Main {
    //The Juni Mail Service uses undirected graphs to plan their mail routes - the vertices represent delivery destinations, and the edges represent two way streets. Whenever possible, the service avoids unnecessary backtracking by looking for eulerian paths and eulerian cycles. A eulerian path is a path in which every edge is only used once. A eulerian cycle is a path in which every edge is only used once, and finishes at the same vertex that it started at. Your objective is not to find a eulerian path or cycle - your objective is only to determine if one exists. To do this, it will be helpful to know these properties:
    //If the graph is not connected there are no eulerian paths or cycles.
    //If the graph is connected then we need to determine how many vertices have an odd degree.
    //If there are zero vertices with an odd degree there is a eulerian cycle.
    //If there are two vertices with an odd degree, there is a eulerian path.
    //If there is anything else, there are no eulerian paths or cycles.
